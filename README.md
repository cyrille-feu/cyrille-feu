### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a Cameroonian engineer in industrial engineering, excellent at design, project management and handling pressure. 
I am heavily interested in new technologies and the possible applications of tools from data science and artificial intelligence in all industrial area. 
This interest lead me to enroll at AIMS for a masterâ€™s degree in industrial mathematics ( Data Sciences and Machine Learning) where I where I gained remarkable skills and experiences in data science, machine learning, website design and deployment, and Business intelligence. I have worked on a few computer science projects using machine learning which has sharpened my natural communication and research capabilities and deepened my knowledge of various programming languages. I am a team player, dynamic, persevering, having a great capacity for work, strong adaptability, and know prioritize tasks. I am eager to collaborate with companies to further my technical skills and equip myself with toolboxes to design accurate models to tackle their problems. I am currently working on an Unsupervised Deep Anomaly Detection model for Multi-Sensor Time-Series Signals in a hydroelectric power plant.
