### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Using data science techniques to leverage business-generated data to support decision making and explore new opportunities are activities that drive and inspire me. I have a solid background in industrial mathematics ( Data science and machine learning), industrial engineering, and physics. Fascinated by new technologies, I have a strong interest in statistical analysis, business intelligence and more particularly in machine learning and data science techniques. My academic, professional and personal experiences have allowed me to develop skills in engineering problems, data extraction, data manipulation and visualization, programming, machine learning, statistical analysis, anomaly detection, multivariate time series analysis, website design and deployment. My ability to adapt, learn and react quickly to new challenges are qualities that allow me to achieve my goals daily. I have a strong passion for trying new things, and I work well with diverse backgrounds.
